# Day -1 (It is not yet the start) - Bilbao to Irun

<br>
<br>
So the journey begins with a little loop back on myself. To reach the start I must get to Irun, on the border with France. Initially I planned to get the train, I like trains they are roomy and usually get some great views of the countryside, however 4.5 hours vs 1.5 on the bus is a little too much. So the bus it was. 
<br>
<br>
Bilbao bus station is a cavernous subterranean hall - good way to save space I suppose. I had some lunch at the station - a cheesy, sweet peppery and bacony affair; very nice! They call them bracadillos I think!?
<br>
<br>
Google search: "spain bracadillo sandwich thing"
<br>
<br>
Its called a Bocadillo actually: "a sandwich made with Spanish bread, usually a baguette or similar type of bread, cut lengthwise"
<br>
<br>
The bus was 40 minutes late...the driver seemingly trying to make up time drove extremely dangerously. Just stay in a single lane please! You don't need to overtake every single bleeding car...
<br>
<br>
The bus afforded some nice views of the countryside so I didn't miss out on that. Just as you leave bilbao you pass some quite impressive mountain/hill things - particularly broody looking with todays low clouds. 
<br>
<br>
We pass by the home of the Basque goddess Mari - she lives and loves (precipitating storms...) in a cave within a mountain called Anboto - the story goes that she meets up, some say every Friday, with her consort god Sugaar - they get it on and beget a good storm! Apparently Sugaar has gone out of fashion these days but Mari stays around due to the virgin mary attractor...
<br>
<br>
Pass through San Sebastian - I should reach there on my feet by end of day 0...looks like a very pretty little city looking forward to that.
<br>
<br>
The following with the help of chatGPT haha;
<br>
<br>
I alight in Irun, meandering towards the hostel with a palpable sense of foreboding. It exudes an austere, almost monastic aura; the spartan bunk beds, the regimented curfews - echoes of an ascetic existence. By 10pm, lights extinguish, doors bolt - a rigid, almost draconian adherence to rules that feels almost... penitential. 
<br>
<br>
I ponder, caught in the tumult of indignation and bemusement, the logic behind such policies. They are adult pilgrims, not wayward adolescents in need of stern governance. A mere room, a sanctuary for nocturnal communion, would hardly be a ruinous expense. 
<br>
<br>
Yet, perhaps there's method in this madness - a deliberate echo of the monastic discipline, an attempt to infuse the pilgrim's journey with an essence of ascetic piety. But the soul, wild and untethered, bristles at such constraints; yearning, always, for the freedom to simply be.
<br>
<br>
Normal service resumes...
<br>
<br>
The person on the reception suggests I walk down to a place called Hondarriba to get some food - its a pretty little seaside town - there is no food...well there are pintxo but I want a meal - this isn't possible until 8pm!! I have a curfew at 10pm and its a 40 min fucking walk....soo pinxto it is...I fear finding food on this journey isn't gonna be the easiest of endeavors...
<br>
<br>
The architecture around here is interesting...its all very swiss chalet vibes not quite what i imagine spain to be...perhaps its a basque thing!? 
<br>
<br>
On the walk to Hondarriba I pass what appears to be a Napoleonic fort of some kind (might be older should research it) - except they have literally built a load of flats inside it! Giant stone ramparts surrounding like 80s flats...very strange. 
<br>
<br>
I am now sat outside a bar type thing drinking a beer and writing this - its getting cold I didn't bring a hoody...silly me! 
<br>
<br>
I think Mari and Sugaar might be getting it on...
