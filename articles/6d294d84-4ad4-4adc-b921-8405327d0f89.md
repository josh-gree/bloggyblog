# The bloggyblog is finito(ish)

<br>
<br>
So I think I have finished what will become my bloggyblog! Built in rust to host "articles" (not sure why I went with that name but hey ho - makes it all sound a little *too* professional...) and images - I hope to use it to document stuff - intially my attempt to walk the camino del norte (starting Oct 1st 2023);

<br>
<br>
...but in the longer term just a place for me to attempt to write something - a thing I dispise but really need to get better at...
