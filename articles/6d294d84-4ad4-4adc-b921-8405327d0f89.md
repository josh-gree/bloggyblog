# The bloggyblog is finito(ish)

So I think I have finished what will become my bloggyblog! Built in rust to host "articles" (not sure why I went with that name but hey ho - makes it all sound a little *too* professional...) and images - I hope to use it to document stuff - intially my attempt to walk the camino del norte (starting Oct 1st 2023);

...but in the longer term just a place for me to attempt to write something - a thing I despise but really need to get better at...

The view from where I am now...

Now I just need to get it deployed somewhere - not sure what domain I will use yet or how it will be hosted - DO droplet maybe...
