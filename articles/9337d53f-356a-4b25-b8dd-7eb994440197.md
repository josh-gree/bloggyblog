# Building a very simple blog with Rust

This post is being served using [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/). Its a very simple bare bones site for hosting articles written by me and images produced or taken by me. We have an index page, a listing of all articles + images and individual image/article pages - the code can be found [here](https://example.com).
